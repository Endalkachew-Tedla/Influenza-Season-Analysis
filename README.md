# Influenza-Season-Analysis
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.
## Preparing for Influenza Season Data Project

**Introduction**: Assisting a medical staffing agency that supplies temporary workers to clinics and hospitals as required. The analysis will aid in strategizing for the influenza season, during which there's heightened demand for additional staff. The ultimate objective is to explore influenza trends and utilize them to proactively anticipate staffing requirements nationwide.

**Business Requirements**: As an analyst, you need technical skills to analyze your data and soft skills to communicate your insights to stakeholders. You’ll start by distilling business requirements and requests into questions you can answer with an analysis. You’ll follow up by sourcing and curating the data to address these questions. After analyzing the data and drawing conclusions or formulating recommendations from your results, you’ll present your insights to stakeholders in an easily consumable format. You’ll find the requirements for your project below. These requirements are what should guide your approach to the analysis. While this project will use data from healthcare, the steps and framework involved can be used for projects in any domain.
  
**Project Overview**: 
- ***Motivation***: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop severe complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.
- ***Objective***: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
- ***Scope***: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

**Target Audience**: The audience for this project is the hypothetical company GameCo, specifically its executives who’ve asked you to gather insights. For a further sense of the “who,” please refer to the hypothetical stakeholder quotes below:
- Vice President of Marketing
- Chief Financial Officer
- Senior Vice President of Sales

**Hypthesis**: If you're older than 65, you're more likely to develop severe complications from the flu.
  
**Data Set**: The following data sets covering influenza in the United States will be used during the project:

**Final Analysis**: 
- You must explain what cleaning you conduct on the data.
- You must select and integrate at least two relevant data sets from different sources.
- You must identify or create a hypothesis that you then test with the data.
- You must look at the relationship between variables with at least one correlation found.
- You must include spatial and temporal visualizations in your final deliverable.
- You must include your conclusions, recommendations, and proposed next steps in your final presentation.
- You must consider the audience when determining which analysis components to include in your final presentation.
  
**Project Deliverables**: This project involved creating a narrative to communicate research findings and insights about the research goals. This narrative was published as a Tableau Storyboard and a video presentation was recorded for stakeholders to effectively present the findings.
